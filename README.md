SlippyFlippyPenguin ===================

The source code for the Slippy Flippy Penguin Challenge Tutorials

The Slippy Flippy Challenge is a series explaining how to use basic
Sprite Kit for arcade games similar to  Flappy Bird.  They can be found
at MakeAppPie.com

For the completed game, it is available at
appstore.com/slippyflippypenguin

I have made directories with the sourcecode for myScene, viewController,
and any graphics used at that point in the game in subdirectories labeld
to the blog entry that describes them. . Install those in your own
project, starting with a sprite kit template.
